                From a young age, I've always had a passion and a keen eye for design, enjoying the process of creating things from scratch 
                Before discovering my passion for web development, I studied psychology, specifically focusing on human behaviors. My journey into coding began unexpectedly when I visited a friend and saw her partner programming a game. The sight of code andinstantly captivated me, awakening a new curiosity. Curious and excited, I started researching web programming and enrolled in a short-term web development course to explore if it was truly my calling.
                `,
bodyText2 : ` After successfully completing the course, I pursued a degree in IT, marking the beginning of my real journey.
During my studies, I had the opportunity to intern at two different companies, primarily working as a UX/UI designer. These experiences, combined with personal projects I've developed during my studies and free time, have solidified my love for creating and designing.I truly believe that becoming a a good web developer requires a blend of technical skills, practical experience, and a dedication to continuous learning. I'm always eager to improve and grow, seizing every opportunity to enhance my abilities. Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!
